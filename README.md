# 100 days of code
During this challenge my main objective will be to cover the broad topic of Embedded Machine Learning. I will try to cover all the aspects from optimizing models for the edge to deploying them on embedded targets.

I will use this repository to store the notes of what I do day to day and hopefully the project that I'll carry out throughout the weeks.

If you want to learn more about Rust, Embedded Software and Machine Learning, you're at the right place üìç

Let's start ! üöÄ
